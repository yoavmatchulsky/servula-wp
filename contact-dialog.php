    <p>At Servula, we realize how frustrating outsourcing might be, so we are here for you, available 24/7 to answer all your questions.</p>
    <div class="questions">
      <h3>What is Servula all about?</h3>
      <p>We started Servula to gather all inbound marketing services into one easy-to-use platform. Our goal is to save you time and money, by providing you with all services you need, at a high quality and for affordable prices.</p>


      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>All services are done manually by hundreds of freelancers that we work with, under our professional supervision; we are not using any automatic submission tools. All services undergo a thorough QA process to ensure their high quality. Following the completion of your order and the QA process, we will send you a detailed report of the work.</p>


      <h3>Which services do you provide?</h3>
      <p>Currently we provide content writing in different quality levels, article submission, posting answers on Q&A sites, commenting in forums and blogs, social bookmarking and more. If you are looking for a specific service that we are not providing at the moment, please let us know and we'll create if for you :)</p>


      <h3>What are your payment methods?</h3>
      <p>We work with credits (1 credit = $2). This means that in order to buy our services, you first have to purchase a credit package or a custom amount of credits. Each service has its own price in credits. Currently we support payments in Paypal and credit cards.</p>


      <h3>Which languages do you offer services in?</h3>
      <p>Currently we support only English and Hebrew, but we are working hard to add more languages to our services.</p>


      <h3>Can I reject a completed order if I'm not satisfied with the results?</h3>
      <p>Of course you can. After we finish working on your order, we make sure that it has been done according to your instructions and that it is in line with our guidelines. Once we approve it, you will a get notification via email includes a detailed report of the work. At this point you will be able to review the work within your dashboard and reject if you find any mistakes. In this case we will fix whatever is wringing and will send it back. If you don't approve/reject the order within 3 days, it will automatically be approved.</p>


      <h3>What are these guidelines you are talking about?</h3>
      <p>Each service has its own guidelines to ensure its quality (you can see the guidelines in each service page). </p>
      <p>For example, here are the guidelines for our article writing service:</p>
      <ul class="answer">
        <li>Articles are written by native speakers only.</li>
        <li>No grammar/spelling mistakes will appear on the article.</li>
        <li>Articles will include relevant subheadings.</li>
        <li>Article will be divided into paragraphs.</li>
        <li>All articles are verified by Copyscape to make sure they are 100% unique.</li>
      </ul>
